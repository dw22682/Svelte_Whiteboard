# Svelte Whiteboard Project
This project was aimed at teaching me the fundementals of svelte.

I have created a working app with multiple tools and a sleek design:
 - brush
 - eraser
 - random circle
 - random rectangle
 - random line
 - colour picker
 - resizable brush size with slider
 - clear canvas button (and keybind)

To show some knowledge of svelte, this project makes use of svelte components and stores
to sync data between the canvas and the buttons for tool selection.
